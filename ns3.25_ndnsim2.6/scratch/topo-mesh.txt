# any empty lines and lines starting with '#' symbol is ignored

# The file should contain exactly two sections: router and link, each starting with the corresponding keyword

# router section defines topology nodes and their relative positions (e.g., to use in visualizer)
router

# each line in this section represents one router and should have the following data
# node  comment     yPos    xPos
Node0	NA	25	25
Node1	NA	25	75
Node2	NA	50	50
Node3	NA	75	25
Node4	NA	75	75
Node5	NA	75	100
Node6	NA	75	125
Node7	NA	75	150
Node8	NA	75	175
Node9	NA	75	200
# link section defines point-to-point links between nodes and characteristics of these links

link

# Each line should be in the following format (only first two are required, the rest can be omitted)
# srcNode   dstNode     bandwidth   metric  delay   queue
# bandwidth: link bandwidth
# metric: routing metric
# delay:  link delay
# queue:  MaxPackets for transmission queue on the link (both directions)
# error:  comma-separated list, specifying class for ErrorModel and necessary attributes
